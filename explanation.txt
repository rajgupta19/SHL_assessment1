SHL Assessment Recommender System - Technical Explanation
=====================================================

1. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
---------------------------------
A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that predicts the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. In our case, we're recommending SHL assessments based on job descriptions.

2. KEY COMPONENTS
----------------

A. Text Processing & Vectorization (TF-IDF)
------------------------------------------
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that reflects:
1. TF (Term Frequency): How often a word appears in a document
2. IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): How rare a word is across all documents

Formula:
TF-IDF = TF * IDF
where:
- TF = (Number of times term t appears in document) / (Total number of terms in document)
- IDF = log(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term t)

B. Similarity Measurement (Cosine Similarity)
-------------------------------------------
Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors:
cos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| ||B||)

Where:
- A·B is the dot product of vectors A and B
- ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B

Range: -1 to 1
- 1: Vectors are identical
- 0: Vectors are orthogonal (completely different)
- -1: Vectors are opposite

C. Evaluation Metrics
--------------------

1. Recall@K
----------
Recall@K = (Number of relevant items in top K) / (Total number of relevant items)

Example:
- Total relevant items: 5
- Items in top 3: 2
- Recall@3 = 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%

2. MAP@K (Mean Average Precision)
--------------------------------
MAP@K = (1/|Q|) * Σ(AP@K for each query)

Where:
- AP@K = (1/min(K,|R|)) * Σ(Precision@k * rel(k))
- rel(k) = 1 if item at position k is relevant, 0 otherwise
- |R| = number of relevant items
- |Q| = number of queries

3. HYBRID RECOMMENDATION APPROACH
--------------------------------

Our system uses a hybrid approach combining:

A. Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF)
----------------------------------
Content-Based Filtering:
- Analyzes item features (text content)
- Creates user profile based on preferences
- Recommends items similar to what user liked before
- Advantages:
  * No cold start problem
  * Can recommend new items
  * Can explain recommendations

B. LLM-Based Understanding
-------------------------
LLM (Large Language Model) Understanding:
- Comprehends semantic meaning
- Understands context and intent
- Can handle complex queries
- Advantages:
  * Better understanding of user intent
  * Can handle ambiguous queries
  * Provides human-like reasoning

4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
---------------------

Theoretical System Flow:

1. Input Processing
   Job Description → Text Preprocessing → Feature Extraction

2. Recommendation Generation
   a. TF-IDF Path:
      - Convert text to vectors
      - Calculate similarity scores
      - Rank by similarity

   b. LLM Path:
      - Analyze job description
      - Identify relevant assessments
      - Provide context-aware recommendations

3. Result Combination
   - Merge both recommendation sets
   - Apply boosting for LLM matches
   - Sort by final scores

4. Evaluation
   - Compare with ground truth
   - Calculate metrics
   - Provide feedback

5. KEY CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
--------------------------

A. Text Preprocessing
--------------------
1. Tokenization: Split text into words
2. Lowercasing: Convert to lowercase
3. Stop Word Removal: Remove common words
4. Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to root form
5. Vectorization: Convert to numerical form

B. Recommendation Scoring
------------------------
Final Score = α * TF-IDF_Score + β * LLM_Score

Where:
- α and β are weights
- TF-IDF_Score is cosine similarity
- LLM_Score is binary (1 if recommended by LLM)

C. Evaluation Framework
----------------------
1. Ground Truth:
   - LLM recommendations as reference
   - Human-validated assessment matches

2. Metrics:
   - Recall@K: Coverage of relevant items
   - MAP@K: Ranking quality of recommendations

3. Validation:
   - Cross-validation with different queries
   - A/B testing with different algorithms

6. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
------------------------

A. Data Collection
-----------------
- Web scraping of SHL catalog
- Fallback to sample data if scraping fails
- Caching for performance optimization

B. Recommendation Generation
---------------------------
1. TF-IDF Processing:
   - Convert job description to vector
   - Calculate similarity with all assessments
   - Rank by similarity score

2. LLM Processing:
   - Send job description to Gemini
   - Get relevant assessment names
   - Use as ground truth for evaluation

C. Result Combination
--------------------
1. Score Calculation:
   - Base score from TF-IDF similarity
   - Boost for LLM-recommended items
   - Final ranking by combined score

2. Output Format:
   - Assessment name
   - URL to assessment
   - Performance metrics

7. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------

A. Caching
----------
- Assessment data cached for 1 hour
- Reduces API calls and processing time

B. Error Handling
----------------
- Graceful fallback to sample data
- Proper error messages
- Logging for debugging

C. Scalability
--------------
- Modular design for easy updates
- Efficient data structures
- Optimized algorithms
